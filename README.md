EmojiVS
=====

EmojiVS is a Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 extension to display GitHub emojis in the editor.

Note that the emojis are downloaded on first use, depending on your connection it might take some time to have all the emojis downloaded.

The extension recognizes the `:name:` form and displays it as an inline image.

The following is used to display the warning emoji:

```csharp
// :warning: scary code
```
